# Module 1, Lesson 1.3: How to Tune Your Guitar

Welcome to the single most important habit you will ever learn. You **must** tune your guitar every time you play. It's not optional!

An out-of-tune guitar makes even the most perfectly played chords sound wrong. This lesson covers all the primary methods, from the easiest modern tools to the classic "by ear" techniques.

## The Goal: "Standard Tuning"

No matter which method you use, the goal is almost always to achieve **Standard Tuning**. This is the universal standard for guitar.

Using **Scientific Pitch Notation** (where **Middle C = C4**), the notes are:

* **String 6 (Thickest):** **E2** (The E two octaves below Middle C)
* **String 5:** **A2** (The A two octaves below Middle C)
* **String 4:** **D3** (The D one octave below Middle C)
* **String 3:** **G3** (The G just below Middle C)
* **String 2:** **B3** (The B just below Middle C)
* **String 1 (Thinnest):** **E4** (The E just above Middle C)

(Mnemonic: **E**ddie **A**te **D**ynamite, **G**ood **B**ye **E**ddie)

## Method 1: The Electronic Tuner (Recommended)

This is the easiest, most accurate, and most recommended method for beginners.

### How It Works
These devices listen to the note you're playing and show you if it's correct.

* **Mobile Apps:** (e.g., GuitarTuna, Fender Tune). These use your phone's microphone to "hear" the note. They are free and very convenient.
* **Clip-On Tuners:** These clip onto your guitar's headstock and "feel" the vibration through the wood. They are excellent in noisy rooms where a microphone might get confused.



### How to Use It
1.  **Start with String 6 (Low E):** Pluck the 6th string (the thickest one) and let it ring.
2.  **Read the Tuner:** The tuner will display the note it "hears."
3.  **Adjust the Pitch:**
    * **Flat (Too Low):** The needle is to the left, or the display shows a note that comes *before* E (like D or D#). You must **tighten** the string's tuning peg.
    * **Sharp (Too High):** The needle is to the right, or the display shows a note that comes *after* E (like F or F#). You must **loosen** the string's tuning peg.
4.  **Get in the Green:** Continue to make small adjustments until the tuner says "E" (some tuners may show "E2") and the needle is perfectly in the center (it will usually turn green).
5.  **Repeat for All Strings:** Do this for all six strings: E, A, D, G, B, E.

## Method 2: Relative Tuning (The "5th Fret" Method)

This is the classic "by ear" method. It doesn't tune your guitar to a perfect concert pitch, but it tunes the guitar **to itself**, so all the strings sound correct *relative* to each other.

**This method requires ONE string to already be in tune.** You must use Method 1 or 3 to get at least one string (usually the Low E) to the right note first.

### How to Use It
The logic is: "The note on one string should sound the *exact same* as the next open string."

1.  **Get String 6 (E2) in Tune:** Use a tuner or piano to get the thickest string to a perfect **E2**.
2.  **Tune String 5 (A2):**
    * Press your finger down on the **5th fret** of the 6th string (the E string). This note is **A2**.
    * Pluck this note and let it ring.
    * Now, pluck the open **5th string** (the A string).
    * Listen. Do they sound the same? Adjust the 5th string's tuning peg until its open note **exactly matches** the note on the 6th string, 5th fret.
3.  **Tune String 4 (D3):**
    * Press down on the **5th fret** of the 5th string (the A string). This note is **D3**.
    * Pluck it. Now pluck the open **4th string** (the D string).
    * Adjust the 4th string's tuning peg until it **matches**.
4.  **Tune String 3 (G3):**
    * Press down on the **5th fret** of the 4th string (the D string). This note is **G3**.
    * Pluck it. Now pluck the open **3rd string** (the G string).
    * Adjust the 3rd string's tuning peg until it **matches**.
5.  **Tune String 2 (B3):** **This is the tricky one!**
    * Press down on the **4th fret** of the 3rd string (the G string). This note is **B3**.
    * Pluck it. Now pluck the open **2nd string** (the B string).
    * Adjust the 2nd string's tuning peg until it **matches**.
6.  **Tune String 1 (E4):**
    * Press down on the **5th fret** of the 2nd string (the B string). This note is **E4**.
    * Pluck it. Now pluck the open **1st string** (the E string).
    * Adjust the 1st string's tuning peg until it **matches**.

**Summary:** 5th fret, 5th fret, 5th fret, **4th fret**, 5th fret.

## Method 3: Tuning to a Reference (Piano/Tuning Fork)

This is how musicians tuned for centuries. You use one "perfect" reference note to tune your guitar.

* **Reference:** This can be a note on a **piano** (or keyboard), a **tuning fork** (which usually plays a perfect "A" note), or another guitar that is already in tune.

### How to Use It (with a Piano)


1.  **Find the Reference Notes:** On the piano, find the *exact* keys for **E2, A2, D3, G3, B3, and E4**. (Remember, **Middle C is C4**).
2.  **Play the Reference:** Press the **E2** key on the piano. Let it ring.
3.  **Match the Pitch:** Pluck your 6th string (E) and use your ear to adjust the tuning peg until the guitar's note "sits" on top of the piano's note, without any wobbling or "beating" (a wah-wah-wah sound).
4.  **Repeat:** Do this for all six strings, matching them to their corresponding notes on the piano:
    * **String 5** -> **A2**
    * **String 4** -> **D3**
    * **String 3** -> **G3**
    * **String 2** -> **B3**
    * **String 1** -> **E4**

This method is very difficult for beginners as it requires a well-trained ear.

## Method 4: Tuning with Harmonics (Advanced)

This is a fast and very accurate "by ear" method, but it's for more advanced players.

It involves lightly touching a string over a specific fret (like the 5th or 7th) to get a high, bell-like "harmonic" tone, and then matching that harmonic to the harmonic on another string. We will cover this in a much later lesson!

## Pro-Tip: Always Tune UP to the Note

This applies to ALL methods.

If your string is **sharp (too high)**, don't just loosen it down to the correct pitch. The gears in the tuning peg can have "slack" and will slip back, making your guitar go flat.

**The Correct Way:**
1.  **Loosen** the string until the note is *below* your target (flat).
2.  **Tighten** the string *up* to the correct pitch.

This locks the gear in place and keeps your guitar in tune for much longer.

## 📝 Practice Assignment

1.  **Tune with a Tuner:** Use **Method 1** (app or clip-on) to tune your guitar perfectly. This is your main task.
2.  **Strum:** Strum all six open strings. It should sound bright, clear, and pleasant. That's the sound of a guitar in tune!
3.  **Try Relative Tuning (Optional):** Once you're in tune, try **Method 2** just to hear it. Pluck the 5th fret of the 6th string, then the open 5th string. Hear how they are the same? This will start training your ear.
