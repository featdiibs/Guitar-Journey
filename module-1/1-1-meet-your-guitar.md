# Module 1, Lesson 1.1: Meet Your Guitar & The 6 Strings

Welcome to your first lesson. Before we play, we need to know what we're working with. This lesson covers the two most fundamental things: the parts of your guitar and the names of the strings.

## A. The Anatomy of Your Acoustic Guitar

Your guitar is made of several parts, each with a job. Here are the most important ones to know:

*(Pro-tip: Find a diagram of an acoustic guitar on Google Images, save it to this folder, and link it here!)*

* **Headstock:** At the top; holds the tuning pegs.
* **Tuning Pegs (or Machine Heads):** You turn these to change the pitch (tune) the strings.
* **Nut:** The small grooved piece (usually white) that the strings pass over at the top of the neck.
* **Neck:** The long piece of wood you'll hold with your left hand.
* **Fretboard (or Fingerboard):** The flat, front side of the neck where you press the strings.
* **Frets:** The thin metal strips that divide the fretboard into sections (notes).
* **Body:** The big, hollow wooden box that makes the sound loud (amplifies it).
* **Soundhole:** The hole in the middle of the body that lets the sound out.
* **Bridge:** The wooden piece on the body that holds the strings in place.
* **Saddle:** The thin white strip on the bridge (like the nut) that the strings rest on.

## B. The Six Strings

This is one of the most important things to memorize. The strings are numbered 1 through 6, starting from the **thinnest string** (closest to the floor) to the **thickest string** (closest to your face).

Each string has a letter name. In standard tuning, they are:

* **String 1 (Thinnest):** **E**
* **String 2:** **B**
* **String 3:** **G**
* **String 4:** **D**
* **String 5:** **A**
* **String 6 (Thickest):** **E**

### How to Remember Them

Here's the most common mnemonic (memory trick), starting from the thickest string (6) and going down to the thinnest (1):

> **E**ddie **A**te **D**ynamite, **G**ood **B**ye **E**ddie

Here is a diagram representing the strings as you look down at your guitar in your lap:
