# Module 1, Lesson 1.2: Holding the Guitar & Pick

This lesson is all about building good habits. How you hold the guitar and the pick is the foundation for everything you'll play. Bad habits now will slow you down later, so let's get this right!

## A. How to Hold the Guitar (Posture)

We're aiming for a relaxed, stable position.

1.  **Sit Straight:** Sit on a chair or stool without arms. Sit near the edge, and keep your back straight but relaxed. Don't slouch!
2.  **Guitar on Your Leg:** Rest the "waist" (the curved-in part) of the guitar body on your **right thigh** (assuming you're right-handed).
3.  **Body Contact:** The back of the guitar should be straight up and down, resting lightly against your chest and stomach.
4.  **Right Arm:** Drape your right forearm over the widest part of the guitar's body (the "lower bout"). This arm holds the guitar in place against your body. You should be able to let go with your left hand, and the guitar *should not* fall.
5.  **Left Hand:** This hand should be **completely free** to move. Its only job is to play notes, *not* to hold up the guitar's neck. The neck should just rest gently in the "web" between your thumb and index finger.

> **Key Idea:** Your body holds the guitar, your right arm strums, and your left hand plays notes. Don't mix up the jobs!

## B. How to Hold the Pick

This is the most common and efficient way to hold a standard pick.

1.  **Make a "Thumbs-Up":** Make a loose fist with your right hand, but point your thumb straight, parallel to the floor.
2.  **Place the Pick:** Place the pick on the side of your index finger. The **pointed end** of the pick should be sticking out, pointing *directly away* from your thumb's knuckle.
3.  **Lock it Down:** Place your thumb flat on top of the pick, "locking" it against your index finger. You should only have a small amount of the pointed tip showing.

It should look like you're holding the pick in the "pad" of your thumb and the *side* of your index finger.



## 📝 Practice Assignment

This is your first "physical" assignment. Don't rush it.

1.  **Posture Check:** Sit down with your guitar 5-10 times. Each time, check your posture: back straight, guitar on the right leg, right arm holding it secure.
2.  **The "No-Hands" Test:** While sitting, practice letting go with your left hand. Does the guitar stay in place? If not, adjust your right arm and posture until it does.
3.  **Pick Practice:** Pick up your pick. Put it down. Pick it up again. Do this 20 times until you can grab it and get the correct grip every time without thinking.
4.  **Your First Strum:** With your pick held correctly, just brush the pick down across all six strings (from thickest to thinnest). This is a "strum." Don't try to play anything, just get a feel for the pick hitting the strings.
